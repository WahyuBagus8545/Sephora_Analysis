Because the datasets used are too large in file size, therefore we created an alternative link to access the datasets.
Link : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bvRwTexny1FFZAJfdvvysVQChrpbeTvR?usp=drive_link

1. Create an assets folder first.
2. Download all datasets in the drive link provided.
3. Put all the datasets files in the assets folder.
4. Adjust the datasets file path in the sephora_functions.py file in the load_dataset() function.
5. Run the program
   ```bash
   python -m streamlit run main.py.
